### A bit about me
I've spent the last two years living and working in Uganda for a solar energy start up and am now living in Europe. I'm currently working on personal projects, from data engineering to electronics and C programming. I love to build and repair, both inside and outside of work, whether it be my own data engineering projects, motorcycle engines, electronics or carpentry.
